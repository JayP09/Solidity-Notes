# Time Units: 
- Solidity provides some native units for dealing with time.
- The variable now will return the current unix timestamp of the latest block (the number of seconds that have passed since January 1st 1970).
- now returns a uint256 by default.
- Note: Unix time is traditionally stored in a 32-bit number. This will lead to the "Year 2038" problem, when 32-bit unix timestamps will overflow and break a lot of legacy systems. So if we wanted our DApp to keep running 20 years from now, we could use a 64-bit number instead â€” but our users would have to spend more gas to use our DApp in the meantime. Design decisions!
- Solidity also contains the time units seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks and years. These will convert to a uint of the number of seconds in that length of time. So 1 minutes is 60, 1 hours is 3600 (60 seconds x 60 minutes), 1 days is 86400 (24 hours x 60 minutes x 60 seconds), etc.
- example :
uint lastUpdated;

// Set `lastUpdated` to `now`
function updateTimestamp() public {
  lastUpdated = now;
}

// Will return `true` if 5 minutes have passed since `updateTimestamp` was 
// called, `false` if 5 minutes have not passed
function fiveMinutesHavePassed() public view returns (bool) {
  return (now >= (lastUpdated + 5 minutes));
}
