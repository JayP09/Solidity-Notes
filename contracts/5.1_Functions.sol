# private/ public functions:
- in Solidity, functions are public by default. this means anyone(or any other contrcat) can call your contract's function and execute its code.
- Thus it's good practice to mark functions as private by default, and then only public the functions you want to expose the world.
example: 
uint[] numbers;

function _addToArray(uint _number) private {
  numbers.push(_number);
}
- As you can see, we use the keyword private after the function name. And as with function parameters, it's convention to start private function names with an underscore (_).

In additon to public and private, solidity has two type of visibility for functions: internal and external.

# Internal functions :
- internal is same as private, except that it's also accessible to contracts that inherit from this contract.

# external functions:
- external is similar to public, except that these functions can only be called outside the contract - they can't be called by other functions inside that contract. 

# payable functions:
- payable functions are part of what makes solidity and Ethereum so cool - they are a sepcial type of function that can receive Ether.
- Let that sink in for a minute. When you call an API function on a normal web server, you can't send US dollars along with your function call â€” nor can you send Bitcoin.
- But in Ethereum, because both the money (Ether), the data (transaction payload), and the contract code itself all live on Ethereum, it's possible for you to call a function and pay money to the contract at the same time.

- example: 
contract OnlineStore {
  function buySomething() external payable {
    // Check to make sure 0.001 ether was sent to the function call:
    require(msg.value == 0.001 ether);
    // If so, some logic to transfer the digital item to the caller of the function:
    transferThing(msg.sender);
  }
}

Note: If a function is not marked payable and you try to send Ether to it as above, the function will reject your transaction.
